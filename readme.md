## POI Jobs

POI Jobs is a job market for the Edo state residents, pioneered by Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu:

- [POI Jobs Website](https://www.poijobs.givitec.com).
- [POI Jobs Login](https://www.poijobs.givitec.com/login).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

## About POI Jobs

Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu (POI) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has pledged to provide ten thousand (10,000) sustainable jobs for Edo residents within the first 100 days in office. These Jobs would demonstrate our commitment to provide employment and empowerment for Edo residents. Take advantage of this opportunity and be among the first ten thousand people to get immediate employment or empowerment before March 2021. Employers are also encouraged to post vacancies on this portal..
